title: About Shadow
---

Our goal is to provide a tool that can be used by anyone with a Linux machine or access to EC2 to hasten the development of research prototypes and reduce the time to deployment.

Mission: Run Tor in a Box
-------------------------

</div>

Shadow was developed because there was a recognized need for an accurate, efficient, and scalable tool for Tor experimentation: using the PlanetLab platform is undesirable due to management overhead and lack of control; existing emulators are far too inefficient when scaling to thousands of nodes; roll-your-own simulators are often too inaccurate or generic to be useful for multiple projects; and experiments on the live Tor network are often infeasible due to privacy risks.

Although originally written with Tor experimentation in mind, Shadow is also useful for researching or prototyping other distributed or peer-to-peer systems.
