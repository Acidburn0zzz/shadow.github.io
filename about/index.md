title: About Shadow
---

Our goal is to provide a tool that can be used by anyone with a Linux machine or access to EC2 to hasten the development of research prototypes and reduce the time to deployment.

Mission: Run Tor in a Box
-------------------------

Shadow was developed because there was a recognized need for an accurate, efficient, and scalable tool for Tor experimentation: using the PlanetLab platform is undesirable due to management overhead and lack of control; existing emulators are far too inefficient when scaling to thousands of nodes; roll-your-own simulators are often too inaccurate or generic to be useful for multiple projects; and experiments on the live Tor network are often infeasible due to privacy risks.
