Run Shadow on EC2 to avoid complex configuration and expensive hardware.

Shadow may be run on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank">Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud</a>, using our pre-configured Ubuntu 11.10-based AMI. This simplifies Shadow setup and is also very useful for those who don't have the hardware capabilities to run large-scale Tor networks on their own machines.

See <a href="/cloud">the Cloud page</a> to get started!
