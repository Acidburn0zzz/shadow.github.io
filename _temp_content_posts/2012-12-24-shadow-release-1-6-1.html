I just tagged Shadow v1.6.1, and added a link on <a title="Download" href="http://shadow.cs.umn.edu/download/">the download page</a>. This is really more like a pre-1.7.0 release, but I wanted to get out some exciting new support for running multi-threaded simulations earlier!

This release includes:
<ul>
        <li>Support for running multi-threaded simulations! (use the "-w" flag to specify the number of worker threads)</li>
	<li>A few bugfixes</li>
</ul>

In preliminary testing, the biggest improvements have been seen when using between 4 and 8 worker threads. Happy simulating!
