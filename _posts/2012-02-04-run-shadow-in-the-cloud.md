Run Shadow on EC2 to avoid complex configuration and expensive hardware.

Shadow may be run on [Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud][amazonec2], using our pre-configured `Ubuntu 11.10`-based AMI. This simplifies Shadow setup and is also very useful for those who don't have the hardware capabilities to run large-scale Tor networks on their own machines.

See [our instructions on the wiki][wiki-cloud] to get started!
