The [design page](/design) has been updated with [a new image](assets/shadow_packet_flow.pdf) from [Steven Murdoch](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/) that explains how application data packets flow between two virtual nodes in a Shadow experiment.

[The new image](assets/shadow_packet_flow.pdf) is a great way to visualize what is going on beneath Shadow's hood. Thanks Steven!
