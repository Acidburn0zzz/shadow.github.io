I just tagged `Shadow v1.9.2`, and added a link on [the download page][dlpage].

This release includes:

 + more flexible graphml representation of the Internet topology
 + updated and much-improved TCP stack - new retransmission, congestion, and autotuning algorithms
 + new minimal Tor controller plug-in
 + other core improvements and [bugfixes][m11issues]

Happy simulating!
